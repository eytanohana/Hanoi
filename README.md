# Hanoi

Towers of Hanoi is a fun game consisting of three pegs on a board  with a stack of different sized discs.
The game starts with the discs stacked from largest to smallest on the first peg. The objective is to move the stack to the third peg. The rules are simple:

1. You can only move a single disk at a time.
1. You can only move the top disc of a stack to any other stack or empty peg.
1. You can't place a larger disc on top of a smaller one.
